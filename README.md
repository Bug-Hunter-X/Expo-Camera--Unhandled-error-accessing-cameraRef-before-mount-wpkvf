# Expo Camera: Unhandled error accessing cameraRef before mount

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the Expo Camera API and how to fix it. The error arises when trying to access the `cameraRef` before the component has fully mounted, resulting in an `undefined` error.

## Problem

The `cameraRef` is not immediately available when the component initially renders.  Accessing it before the component mounts leads to an error because it's undefined. This is often caused by calling functions that depend on `cameraRef` within the constructor or before the useEffect hook has finished its first execution.

## Solution

The solution involves utilizing the useEffect hook to guarantee that the component is mounted before accessing the `cameraRef`. This ensures that `cameraRef` is defined and prevents the error. The code example shows the correct implementation.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `expo start` to start the project.
